## 📌 About This Challenge

This repository documents my **75 Hard DSA Challenge** — a focused journey to master **advanced Data Structures & Algorithms** by solving and explaining **only HARD problems** from **LeetCode** and **Codeforces**.

Each day includes:
- ✅ Clean, optimized solution
- ✅ Conceptual explanation
- ✅ YouTube explanation video
- ✅ Public progress tracking

This is not random grinding.  
This challenge is about **depth, consistency, and engineering-level thinking.**

## 🎯 Objectives

- Master advanced DSA patterns used in real interviews and contests
- Improve problem decomposition & optimization skills
- Build the ability to explain complex solutions clearly
- Create a public, verifiable proof of consistency
- Prepare strongly for interviews, contests, and backend/system problem-solving

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Binary Search on Answer
- Monotonic Stack & Deque
- Sliding Window & Heaps
- Dynamic Programming (Classic, Optimized, Bitmask)
- Graphs (BFS, DFS, State Compression, Shortest Paths)
- Advanced Greedy
- Trees & Advanced Recursion
